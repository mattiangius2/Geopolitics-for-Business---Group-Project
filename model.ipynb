            "  10. Localization and national champion development: Aramco's localization and national champion development initiatives are supported by the government, but they also require significant investments and pose some risks.\n",
            "  11. Energy transition and climate change: The report highlights Aramco's efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and invest in low-carbon technologies, but the transition to a low-carbon economy poses significant risks and challenges for the company.\n",
